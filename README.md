# hello-world
My name is **Maggie**.  I'm 34 years old, and I live in Ohio.

One thing I'm deeply passionate about is art. I started painting when I was 10 years old. Throughout time, I have evolved from an interest in realism to an interest in the deeply abstract. Most recently, I've been creating 3D textural paintings with acrylic paint that plays with the idea of color and texture alone.  Most of my paintings start off with the thought, "I wonder what would happen if..."

Some say your best and worst trait are the same thing, and if that's true mine would be **not taking life too seriously.** I'm hoping to have a **fruitful career in coding and hope to have a family someday soon.**
